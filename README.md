## Project Description

This project explores how internet use and social media trends have shifted in Zimbabwe from 2020 to 2025 — and forecasts what’s next. Using big data tools and Python, it analyzes how these digital trends impact everyday life, especially in key sectors like SMEs, healthcare, and agriculture.

Data was sourced from **DataReportal**, **GSMA Intelligence**, and others, then cleaned, visualized, and modeled to uncover real insights.  
The analysis also highlights key challenges like **high data costs**, **poor infrastructure**, and **digital literacy gaps** — all crucial in shaping the country's digital future.
